# 02 Getting started with functional programming in Kotlin

- A higher-order function accepts other functions as parameters. 
- Loops can be written functionally by using tail call recursion. 
- The compiler can warn us if tail call elimination was not successful. 
- Generic polymorphic functions can be written by introducing type variables to functions. 
- Anonymous functions can be passed as parameters to higher-order functions. 
- Types in method signatures can be used to drive the implementation of poly-morphic functions.
