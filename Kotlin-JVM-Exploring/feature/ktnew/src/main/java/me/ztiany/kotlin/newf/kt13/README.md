# [Kotlin 1.3 New Features](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/whatsnew13.html)

- Coroutines 转正；
- Multiplatform projects 完全重写；
- Since Kotlin 1.3, kotlinx.serialization ships with the Kotlin compiler distribution on par with the other compiler plugins. The main difference is that you don't need to manually watch out for the Serialization IDE Plugin being compatible with the Kotlin IDE plugin version you're using: now the Kotlin IDE plugin already includes serialization。
