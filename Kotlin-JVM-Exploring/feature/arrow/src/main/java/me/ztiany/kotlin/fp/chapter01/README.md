# 01 What is functional programming?

- Functional programming results in increased code modularity. 
- Modularity gained from programming in pure functions leads to improved testability, code reuse, parallelization, and generalization. 
- Modular functional code is easier to reason about.  Functional programming leads us toward using only pure functions. 
- A pure function can be defined as a function that has no side effects.  A function has a side effect if it does something other than returning a result. 
- A function is said to be referentially transparent if everything it does is represented by what it returns.
- The substitution model can be used to prove the referential transparency of a function.
